2. Dataset

For our dataset, we selected a collection of crime that has occurred in Denver, from disturbing the peace to motor vehicle theft.
We thought that this dataset was interesting because it has the potential to give an insightful look into the crime and safety of a very local area, making it
relevant to us. The dataset is also fairly simple to understand, since most people know what the crimes within our dataset are, so clarifying the significance of our data
will be made simpler without having to give long-winded explanations in our final report.

Loading Data:

Firstly, some of the rows in the .csv had less columns than they should so we made a python script to ensure the 
data format is consistent. Next, we used the following command to create the table:

CREATE TABLE incident (
    objectid INT,
    incident_id DOUBLE PRECISION,
    offense_id DOUBLE PRECISION,
    offense_code VARCHAR(50),
    offense_code_extension VARCHAR(50),
    offense_type_id VARCHAR(50),
    offense_category_id VARCHAR(50),
    first_occurrence_date DATE,
    last_occurrence_date DATE,
    reported_date DATE,
    incident_address VARCHAR(255),
    geo_x DOUBLE PRECISION,
    geo_y DOUBLE PRECISION,
    geo_lon DOUBLE PRECISION,
    geo_lat DOUBLE PRECISION,
    district_id CHAR(1),
    precinct_id VARCHAR(50),
    neighborhood_id VARCHAR(50),
    is_crime BOOLEAN,
    is_traffic BOOLEAN,
    victim_count INT,
    x DOUBLE PRECISION,
    y DOUBLE PRECISION
);

For loading the data, we were able to get it working for local DB instances (windows) with: 

\COPY incident FROM 'C:\Users\<user>\Downloads\CLEANED_Denver_Crime.csv' (FORMAT csv, HEADER)

But we weren't able to load directly from a file onto the codd.mines.edu domain as it could not find the file so we
wrote a separate python script that would iterate through each row of the .csv running the following command:

INSERT INTO incident (
    objectid, incident_id, offense_id, offense_code, offense_code_extension, offense_type_id,
    offense_category_id, first_occurrence_date, last_occurrence_date, reported_date, 
    incident_address, geo_x, geo_y, geo_lon, geo_lat, district_id, precinct_id, 
    neighborhood_id, is_crime, is_traffic, victim_count, x, y
) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s);

3. Analysis

Analysis Question 1:
    "What Neigborhood(s) are associated with the highest frequency for non-business related robberies?"

SQL Query of Note:

CREATE TABLE relevant_crimes_rq1 AS
SELECT *
FROM incident
WHERE  
      offense_type_id ILIKE 'burglary-residence-%' 
   OR offense_type_id ILIKE 'robbery-street-%' 
   OR offense_type_id ILIKE 'robbery-residence' 
   OR offense_type_id ILIKE 'burglary-other'
   AND neighborhood_id IS NOT NULL
   AND neighborhood_id != '';

( -- Top Burgaled Neigborhoods
    SELECT 
        neighborhood_id,
        COUNT(*) AS total_crimes
    FROM relevant_crimes_rq1
    GROUP BY neighborhood_id
    ORDER BY total_crimes DESC
    LIMIT 5
)
UNION ALL
( -- Bottom Burgaled Neighborhoods
    SELECT 
        neighborhood_id,
        COUNT(*) AS total_crimes
    FROM relevant_crimes_rq1
    GROUP BY neighborhood_id
    ORDER BY total_crimes ASC
    LIMIT 5
);

Relevant Output + Explanation:

(10 rows)

The above output shows us the neigborhoods with the most frequent non-commercial robberies/(violent and otherwise) burglaries historically. This is the
historical frequency of burglaries. This data can be used to interpret the proprtion and other statistics if needed as well. This query's output illustrates which
neighborhoods have historically experienced the most, highest frequency, of robberies excluding those done on business locations thus answering our research
question. This question is interesting as it allows us to find a correlation, if any, between specific Denver neighborhoods and non-business related robberies.


Analysis Question 2:
    "What are the proprtions of each crime?"

SQL Query of Note:

SELECT offense_type_id, COUNT(offense_type_id) * 1.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM incident) 
    AS proportion 
    FROM incident 
    GROUP BY offense_type_id 
    ORDER BY proportion DESC
    limit 15;

Relavent Query Output:

On the above output from the relevant query, we can see that compared to all reported crime in Denver the
proprtion of motor-vechile-theft is proportionally much larger than any other crime committed in the Denver
region. This query's output also lists the proportion of other crimes committed in the Denver area displaying
the proportional break down of each offense. This proportional break down directly answers our question.
This question is interesting because it illustrates the crime offenses that most often happen in the Denver 
area, an area specifically relevant to us as Colorado students.
