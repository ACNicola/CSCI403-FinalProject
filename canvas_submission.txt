2. Dataset

For our dataset, we selected a collection of crime that has occurred in Denver, from disturbing the peace to motor vehicle theft.
We thought this dataset was interesting because it has the potential to give an insightful look into the crime and safety of a very local area, making it
relevant to us. The dataset is also fairly simple to understand, since most people know what the crimes within our dataset are, so clarifying the significance of our data
will be made more simple without having to give very long-winded explanations in our final report.
